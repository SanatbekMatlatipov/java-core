# Challenge Exercise OOP1
Create a new class for a bank account.
Create fields for account characteristics like:
 - account number.
 - account balance
 - customer name
 - email
 - phone number

Create getters and setters for each field; <br>
Create two additional methods:
 - one for depositing funds into the account
 - one for withdrawing funds from the account

A customer should not be allowed to withdraw funds if that withdrawal takes their balance negative.

Create a new project called ClassesChallenge with the usual Main class with the usual main method

You will create an instance of an Account class and test your withdrawal and deposit methods.

You will print information to the console that confirms what the balance is after the methods are called.
